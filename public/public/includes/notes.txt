**testing
ranged units counter attack should be variable
if page not focused then wont transmit messages



********* new units:
** ninja -> moves 5 by foot, stealthed, weak medium defense but strong light attack
	flak damage
	can capture but loses stealth when capturing

** humvee -> moves 4 by wheel, weak medium defense, moderate light attack with flak,
	can capture
	if it dies from heavy or medium attacker, drops a heavy commando

*spiders cannot be countered
*stealth tanks should hide

// map should include land cutoff when scrolled out of grid

// search edit

// player.check units

// efficiency
// instead of player makes move, affecting the game
// allow 100% access to making moves, so server connects will go faster,
// only allow user input for their team but dont restrict moves in the engine

change move data to be based on direction and turn
unit, dir, moves[(move amt), (turn), etc.]


// sever attack wont work
// console server side move + client response
// player 2 in server data starts as player 1 in game
// fix order for players on server response

// get rid of global vars
// rid of INTERFACE -> send game to socket on initialization
