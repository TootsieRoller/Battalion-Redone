ALPHA:

Levels.Draw(0, charCanvas, 0, 0, 100, 100);

***server
*allow users to change password
*erase all added db data cause i was testing it a lot
*each user needs {
	username,password,email,level,points,totalGames,gamesWon
}

***testing
*lancer counter attack should not double
*ranged units counter attack should be variable
	in units.Act() -> fix if(current_path.can_attack())

***if page not focused then wont transmit messages
** fix by having queue of moves, and on focus execute the queue


FINAL PRE-RELEASE:

******
SERVER / LOBBY STUFF

Since the server and the lobby are open to js console messages,
the server will have to send an excrypted message that the client
decrypts and sends back in order to validate the message

or else clients will be able to crash the server with open games that dont exist, etc.

******

// map should include land cutoff when scrolled out of grid
